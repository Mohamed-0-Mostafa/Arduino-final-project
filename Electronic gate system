Electronic gate system
This is a system which is used for detecting passing humans into a room.

There are Two main modes:

The first mode:
When someone enters the room, The servo motor will simulate opening the door and
The first photoresistor ( ldr 1 ) will sense the person and icrease the number of humans by 1.


The Second mode:
When someone leaves the room, The servo motor will simulate opening the door and
The second photoresistor ( ldr 2 ) will sense the person and decrease the number of humans by 1.

Whenever the number of the humans inside the room exceeds five persons The buzzer gets fired as an alarm and 
The servo motor (the door) cannot be opened until one or more persons leaves the room.

Components used to form the system:

Arduino:
        The microcontroller which control the system.
Breadboard:
        is used to organise the wires and the other components.
        
        Hardware Abstraction Layer Drivers:
        Button:
             is used for switching the system on and switching it off.
        Servo Motor:
             is used for simulating opening the door either the person is entering or leaving the room.
        Buzzer:
             is used as an alarm, when the number of the humans inside the room exceeds five persons.
        (2) LDRs:
             are used for sensing the person entering or leaving the room.
                The first one for the people entering the room.
                The second one for the people leaveing the room.
